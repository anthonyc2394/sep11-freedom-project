# Choosing My Tool
##### 11/07/22

In this blog entry, I will be discussing how I chose my tool for my freedom project. The tool that I chose was [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/learn) that allows users to create music using Python or Javascript. My end goal for my freedom project is to create a music platform where people can create their own music and apply visuals to their work. The music platform would also save your work so you can edit your work instead of starting all over.
