# Entry 4

### Content

In this blog entry, I will be discussing my progress with [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/learn) and my MVP for my freedom project.

I plan on uploading my music sounds onto Earskecth because I don't really like the sounds they offer, but I will try to make at least 1 song using sounds from Earsketch because I don't want to take the easy way out.

### EDP

Right now I'm on steps 4 and 5 of the Engineering Design Process because I am constantly trying work on my MVP but I'm also changing my plan so I can finish my MVP on time and maybe go beyond my MVP.

### Skills

Some skills I used were time mangement, collaboration, and problem decomposition. I have shown problem decomposition and time management by making a plan that manages what I have to accomplish during the week so I can finish my MVP on time. I used collaboration to get inspiration/ideas from others that are also using Earsketch. Alan and I have been teaching each other and working on some music projects/ideas together.
