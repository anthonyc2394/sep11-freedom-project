# Tinkering With My Tool
##### 02/11/23

### Content

In this blog entry, I will be discussing what I have learned and practiced from [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/learn).

``` js
var drum1 = OS_SNARE03;
var beat_string = "0---0---0-0-0---";

// Looping our beat
for (var measure = 1; measure < 5; measure++) {
    makeBeat(drum1, 1, measure, beat_string);
}
```

### EDP

Right now, I'm at step 0 of the Engineering Design Process because I haven't defined a problem yet and have no idea what to create, but I'm hoping that in my next entry I will have answers.

### Skills

Some skills that I used during the past few weeks were How to learn and How to Google. I used the How to learn skill by remembering how I learned my SEP10 tool the best. Last year I learned best through videos and visual examples, so I used the How to Google skill to find good video tutorials that help me learn Earsketch using Javascript.
