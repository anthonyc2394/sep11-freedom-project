### Content

In this blog entry, I will be walking you through the process of me finishing the mvp of my freedom project and the next steps for my project. For 2 months, I've been focused on one song made entirely made with [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/learn). I started of by using Earsketch sound seach engine to listen to guitar and piano sounds from different genres (pop, hip hop and rnb) and I would favorite the, so it would be easier to find it later on.

Some of my favorite sounds are:

* `AK_UNDOG_PIANO_3`
*
*

```js
// Loops
for (var measure = 9; measure < 25; measure += 2) {
    fitMedia(AK_UNDOG_PERC_KICK_2, 4, measure, measure + 1)
}
for (var measure = 10; measure < 25; measure += 2) {
    fitMedia(AK_UNDOG_OOHS_AHHS_1, 4, measure, measure + 1);
}
```

The song code is [here](https://github.com/anthonyc2394/freedom-project-mvp/blob/main/script.js)


The next steps for my freedom project si to create a pop song and then start creating visuals (videos) using [p5js](https://p5js.org/) for each song. So far I know
